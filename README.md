Ludo Dice Distribution Analyzer      by Nayan Agawral
Project Description
In Ludo, you roll two dice. Have you ever felt like you roll 7s all the time, but 2s and 12s are rare? This is a C program to act as a scientific simulator.It helps test if the game is as “random” as we think! The program prints out both the actual probability from simulation and the real math probability, so you can compare and see if your “luck” is truly just luck.

Concepts Used
C Programming:
-For loops
-Arrays
-Functions (rand(), custom die roller)
-If/switch statements (for logic)
-printf, scanf

Maths:
-Probability
-Random experiments (stochastic modeling)
-Theoretical vs. experimental probabilities

How to Compile: Open your terminal and run: gcc ludo.c -o ludo

How to Run After compiling, you can run the program with: ./ludo

The program will ask how many rolls you want to simulate. For example, enter 1000000 for a million rolls.
